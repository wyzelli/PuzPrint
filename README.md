This program reads a text file named 'puzzles.txt', each line being a 0 delimited 81 character Sudoku Puzzle String, and outputs a pdf 'sudoku_puzzles.pdf' with two puzzles per page centred.

PDF creation uses the fpdf module - install this by running 'pip install fpdf' (preferably from an elevated cmd prompt as that will install a shared copy rather than a user copy).

Docx and RTF are not currently working - they are just here as I'm experimenting with them a bit.
